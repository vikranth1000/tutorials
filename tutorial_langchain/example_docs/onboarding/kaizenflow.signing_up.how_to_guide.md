# Signing up to the project

- Look around the repo and make sure that you are really interested in what we
  are doing, and you have time to contribute
  - Ponder on the **IMPORTANT** note about committing to contribute to the
    project [here](/README.md#commitment-to-Contribute)
  - Please fork, star, watch the KaizenFlow repo so that GitHub promotes our
    repo (this will help us promote our effort)

- Fill out the
  [Contributor Info form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6IogJch1YUMSc_GfRcMIltGEEZ1xTotbRVkwZzWT7eBz_jA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
  - It's meant to just get basic contact info and technical skills about you
  - Don't worry: by working with us, you will quickly become a coding machine

- Communication with the project teams happens through:
  - GitHub on the [repo](https://github.com/kaizen-ai/kaizenflow) like in any
    open-source development
  - Slack IM channel for higher bandwidth discussion
  - Through the KaizenFlow mailing list

- Accept the invite from GitHub that we will send you
  - Again please don't forget to fork, star, watch the KaizenFlow repo so that
    GitHub promotes our repo

- Accept the invite to join the Google Drive that we will send you

- On-boarding Tasks
  - Once the invitation is accepted, an issue will be created by the title
    `On-board \<YOUR FIRST NAME LAST NAME\> Aka <YOUR GITHUB_HANDLE>`. If not
    assinged, assign it to yourself and go through the particular checklist from
    the issue one-by-one, marking each item as done when **it's actually done**.
