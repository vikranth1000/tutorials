    "\n",
    "What is `Neo4j`?\n",
    "`Neo4j` is a graph database management system developed by Neo4j, Inc. It is an ACID-compliant transactional database with native graph storage and processing. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Neo4j with Python using the `neo4j` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the basics of Neo4j and graph databases.\n",
    "- Learn how to set up and connect to Neo4j.\n",
    "- Create, query, and manipulate data in Neo4j using Cypher.\n",
    "- Explore visualization techniques for graph data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Neo4j installed and running on your system.\n",
    "- Python installed with `neo4j` and `py2neo` libraries.\n",
    "    * `neo4j` is library that serves as a python client to establish connection to\n",
    "       Neo4j database servers.\n",
    "    * `py2neo`\n",
    "- This is done through building the docker image. Refer `neo4j.API.md`\n",
